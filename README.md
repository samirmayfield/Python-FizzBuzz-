# Python-Fizzbuzz
FizzBuzz in python
basically fizzbuzz is a common interview question you will recieve. 
You can approach this from many angles
and I had chose to do this differently then the way I did it in javascript previously. 
This will check if the remainder of 3, and 5 = 0 
and if both this will print "FizzBuzz"
else if it does just 3 it will do the "fizz" string,
and else if it does the 5 it will just do the "buzz" string. 
else it will just print the number. 
I can't say this is the best method, 
but it will produce the result. 
I think the main issue is that, if you wanted to change the buzz to something else like 7,
then you have to change all of the 5's.
In this small of code, that isn't an issue, but scaled up, that could be a problem.
